### üåê Remote Multiplayer
- **Peer-to-Peer Hosting:**
  - One player hosts the game, others join directly.
  - UPnP automatically sets up port forwarding when possible.
  - Manual port forwarding may be required in some network setups.
- **How to Host:**
  1. Click "Host" in the multiplayer menu.
  2. Enter your player name.
  3. If UPnP succeeds, your external IP will be displayed.
  4. Share your IP and port (default: 8080) with friends.
  5. Click "START" when all players have joined.
- **How to Join:**
  1. Click "Join" in the multiplayer menu.
  2. Enter the host's IP address.
  3. Enter your player name.
  4. Wait for the host to start the game.
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - If UPnP fails, you'll need to manually forward port 8080 (UDP) in your router.
  - If players can't connect, try using a VPN service that supports direct connections.
  - For NAT traversal issues, ensure both the host and clients have UDP port 8080 open.

### ‚ö° Electricity System
- **Generator:** 
  - Managed with fuel (electricity) and heat levels.
  - Players use coolant to reduce generator heat.
  - BLACKOUT occurs if fuel runs out or generator overheats.
- **Electricity Levels:**
  - `100-75%`: Bright lights; containment cells stay closed.
  - `75-50%`: Dim lights; 30% chance of containment cell timers (10-120s).
  - `50-25%`: Flickering lights; 80% chance of door timers (10-120s).
  - `25-0%`: Heavy flickering; containment cells on timers (10-120s).
- **BLACKOUT Events:**
  - Fog horn sounds, ambient noise stops.
  - All containment doors open, lights go black.
  - 5 monsters spawn immediately.
